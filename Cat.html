        <p>The British longhair is a sweet tempered, round-faced teddy bear of a cat. 
           These fluffy felines originated in Britain and are a cross between the British
           shorthair and Persian cat breeds. The British longhair has technically been
           around for centuries, but has only recently been recognized as its own breed.</p>

        <p>Himalayans are a medium-sized sub-breed of longhair cat. They are almost 
           identical to Persians except that they have brilliant blue eyes and the colorpoint 
           markings of a Siamese. That means they have creamy bodies with a darker face, ears,
           feet, and tail.</p>

        <h2>About Dog and Cat</h2>

        <p>Dogs tend to work together to get things done, so your dog will involve himself in your 
            routines as a way to connect with you. Cats are solitary hunters. They are very
            independent creatures, and often don't rely on their humans for much past their basic 
            needs of food and a clean litter box.</p>
