        <p>The Bulldog is friendly and easygoing; he gets along with everyone.
           He can be a slow learner, but once he knows something, he's got it for good.
           Bulldogs don't tend to be barkers. Usually their appearance 
           alone is enough to frighten off intruders.</p>

        <p>Poodles are good family dogs â€” fun, energetic, smart and easy to train.
           They do best with plenty of exercise for both mind and body and prefer
           to be with people most of the time. They are not good kennel dogs. Socialization
           should begin early and include other people, other pets and the grooming routine.</p>

           cheerful, small dog breed with a love of mischief and a lot of love to give. With 
           their black eyes and fluffy white coat, the Bichon looks almost like a child's toy.</p>

        <img src="dogImg/Dalmatian_dog.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="Dalmatian_dog photo">
       

        <p>Dalmatians are highly energetic, playful and sensitive dogs. They are loyal to their
           family and good with children, although some Dalmatian experts caution that the breed 
           may be too energetic for very small children. These dogs are intelligent, can be well 
           trained and make good watchdogs.</p>

        <p>The dog was the first domesticated animal to be domesticated by humans. People's True 
           Friend Since the Stone Age, people have bred dogs. A dog never betrays its master and
           abandons it. He even gives up his life for the Lord</p>

        <h2>About Dog and Cat</h2>

        <p>Dogs tend to work together to get things done, so your dog will involve himself in your 
           routines as a way to connect with you. Cats are solitary hunters. They are very
           independent creatures, and often don't rely on their humans for much past their basic 
           needs of food and a clean litter box.</p>
